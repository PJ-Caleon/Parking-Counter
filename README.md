# Parking-Counter

This project was created March 3, 2024. It is just now published here for portfolio.

# Description
The project is a prototype for a parking gate that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect cars. A servo motor controls the gate, allowing a maximum of three cars to enter. If a fourth car tries to enter, the gate remains closed. Exiting cars can press a button to open the gate. LED indicators display the current car count.
